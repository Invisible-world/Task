# Introduction
The aplication named itself can be descriptive enough :).Here, i like to mention the features it possess like: User's  Data Filtering along with sorting data on clicking table header.
It was too be built with limited amount of time and project was small enough to follow the standard software development practice like: prototyping the design,breaking the features  into smaller task and assigning task uniquely  and creating a branch for each and every feature to be implemented.
As Speaking of  user's data -i have two json file which refrence each other with same unique id - which i have fetched asynchronously and is loaded to the component's state initialized  as array when the page gets loaded/rendered.After which ,i merged two arrays data and outputs a single array of data by filtering the data's having same id.  

# What i like to accomplished further ?
I would like to add more features to the project in near future if i got a time to do so Like:pagination,Crud operations,developing backend server to post the user's data and store in a database .For that , I will definitely  follow the standard software development practice as mention in Introduction section . 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
