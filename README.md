# Introduction
The aplication named itself can be descriptive enough :).Here, i like to mention the features it possess like: User's  Data Filtering along with sorting data on clicking table header.
It was too be built with limited amount of time and project was small enough to follow the standard software development practice like: prototyping the design,breaking the features  into smaller task and assigning task uniquely  and creating a branch for each and every feature to be implemented.
As Speaking of  user's data -i have two json file which refrence each other with same unique id - which i have fetched asynchronously and is loaded to the component's state initialized  as array when the page gets loaded/rendered.After which ,i merged two arrays data and outputs a single array of data by filtering the data's having same id.  

# What i like to accomplished further ?
I will like to add more features to the project in near future if i got a time to do so Like:pagination,Crud operations,developing backend server to post the user's data and store in a database .For that , I will definitely  follow the standard software development practice as mention in Introduction section .
